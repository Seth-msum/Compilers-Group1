# Compilers-Group1

## This is a git test

- Parser has a look variable that needs to be fixed

- Parser has different visit methods.

- missig visit fucntion in the compilationUnit

### Judahs edits
- I added BlockStatementNode
    - It refrences an identifier node but Im not sure what that is
- Created identifierNode and it seems similar or to replace literalNode
    - based of lab05 - time 13:36 - LiteralNode is not used.
- I commented out the visit fuctions in the Parser
