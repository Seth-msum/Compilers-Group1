# Compilers-Group1

# To compile:
This command to clean all left up classes:
```
rm -r assign4/*.class assign4/lexer/*.class assign4/parser/*.class assign4/pretty/*.class assign4/visitor/*.class
```
To compile:
```
javac assign4/Main.java
```
To run:
```
java assign4.Main
```
Lazy Command:
```
rm -r assign4/*.class assign4/lexer/*.class assign4/parser/*.class assign4/pretty/*.class assign4/visitor/*.class; javac assign4/Main.java; java assign4.Main
```
Note that if you run and compile from just outside the assign4 directory, you dont have to mess with classpath.
Also have the input just outside the assign4 folder as well if it doesnt return anything after running.
