theres more earlier but i started tracking late
...

Made Real class in lexer
Made Type class in lexer
the numeric function returns false for boolean 
the Lexer.java has new reserve words - added if, else, while, do , break, int, char, bool, float
added readch(char c) function to Lexer
	It is needed in the scan function
	It is used in the scan function to recognise Words that are two ormore characters long.
The num part of the scan function was changed to accept float values.

	I changed the Real class to accept float instead of int, IDK why it was int.

In ASTVisitor, "added n.decls.accept(this) ;" to the BlockStatementNode visit
	added a visit function for Declarations class

Modified BlockStatementNode to include Declaratoins

Since stmt derives block, the BlockStatementNode should then extend StatementNode

Added DeclarationNode and TypeNode visit functions to ASTVisitor.

Added the Declarations class to the ast folder

in the pretty parser or related, be sure to check if the decls variable for Declarations is empty or not

Added the DeclarationNode class to the ast folder

added the ArrayTypeNode visit to ASTVisitor

added the TypeNode class to ast folder
	possible issue at the visit function in ASTVisitor


added to visit AssignmentNode of ASTVisitor, an else if condition for RealNode

added to ASTVisitor, a visit function for ExprNode

added the ExprNode to ast folder

LiteralNode was changed to NumNode

in parser, added n.decls instance and visit for BlockStatementNode

in parser, added visit function for Declarations

in parser, added visito funtcion for TypeNode
!! possible issue with parser -> TypeNode visitor not looking for bool or char

!! we need to implememt the different cases for parser -> Statemtnts. if, while, do, block
